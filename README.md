# mTicketSpoof

The app began as a bet with a friend and should **not** be used. This was more for practice. The app is an exact copy of MBTA's current mTicket app with the functionality to add/remove tickets. Currently figuring out the three colors picked, which is what initially brought the bet up. Given the nature of an offline ticket, seems to be choosing the colors based on the date and time, rotating colors from red through purple then to pink and back.
